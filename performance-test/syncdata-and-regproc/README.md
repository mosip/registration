# How to run performance scripts using Apache JMeter tool
* Download Apache JMeter from https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi
* Download JMeter Plugin Manager jar file from https://jmeter-plugins.org/get/ , and install by placing the it in "Jmeter/apache-jmeter-X.X.X/lib/ext"
* Download script for the required module from the [script](script/) folder of this repo.
* Start JMeter by running the jmeter.bat/jmeter.sh as per your OS. 
* Load downloaded *.jmx script onto JMeter. If prompted, install the required plugins.
* If plugins were installed, restart JMeter.
* Update "User Defined Variables" within the JMeter scripts. This list holds environment endpoint URL, protocols, users, secret keys, passwords, runtime file path, support file path etc.
* Validate the scripts is working functionally. 
    * Disable all "thread groups" within the test plan by clicking 'disable'. 
    * Enable and execute only one thread at one time during this step.  
    * Sequentially, execute each thread group with Number of VUser and Iteration set to 1. 
    * Go to [script execution steps](#script-execution-steps) for further detail.
* Take average scenario response time obtained from above test and update "Scenario Response time" column in [MOSIP_TPS_Thread_setting_calculator](MOSIP_TPS_Thread_setting_calculator-RegProc_SyncData.xlsx)
* Execute a dry run for 10 min. The execution duration is controlled by "testDuration" variable.
* Use [MOSIP_TPS_Thread_setting_calculator](MOSIP_TPS_Thread_setting_calculator-RegProc_SyncData.xlsx) to calculate the thread settings required for your target load.
* Execute performance run with various loads in order to achieve targeted NFR's.
* Execute performance run with various loads in order to achieve targeted NFR's. For a performance run, all scenarios (S01, S02, S03....) should be enabled and executed at the same time.

# Setup points before execution
* This script uses `mosip-packet-creator` tool as a background service to generate new packets. Follow the steps in [PacketCreatorToolSetup](../PacketCreatorToolSetup.md) first to start the service. The tool should be running in background while the JMeter script is running. 
* `A02 Create Machines` creates a large number of Machines based on requirements within the Master Database that contains unique keys. 5000 pre-generated keys are available in [generated_keys](KeyGenMadeEasy/generated_keys.7z). More keys can be generated by running [KeyGenMadeEasy](KeyGenMadeEasy/README.md) script. Python installation will be required to run `KeyGenMadeEasy`. 
* `S03 Get Transaction details from RID` requires an existing list of RIDs in the database. If RIDs do not already exist, new RIDs can be created using [PacketCreator_and_Upload_Test_Script](../packet-credential-processing/README.md) as well. 
* The "registration-processor-common-camel-bridge" pod should be stopped until all preparation (P01-P03) is completed. (i.e. Number of pods = 0).
* Delete runtime files created during previous execution from {runTimeFilePath} folder.



# Script execution steps:

    * A00 Auth Token Generation (Preparation) - In this thread group we are creating the authorization token values of Regpoc and Resident - Using User Id which will be saved to a file in the Run Time Files in bin folder of JMeter. The authorization token has expiration time which is controlled by MOSIP settings. Ensure the tokens remain valid throughout the duration of the test execution. After running this thread, enable "Load Regproc Auth Token From File", "Load Resident Auth Token From File" & "Load Auth Token For Syncdata From File" in JMeter.

    * A01 Create Users and Centres for Zones (Setup) - This thread group will create a list of users and centre’s within the master DB and activate them. The centres will be based on the list of zones and location provided in "D01_A01_zones.csv". This step only needs to be executed once per environment.
    
    * A02 Create Machines (Setup) - This thread group will create a list of Machines within the master DB and activate them. The list will be based on the list of Centres created under step A01. The machines will also use the keys provided in the folderpath "{keyPath}/reg_######". These keys can be generated using `KeyGenMadeEasy` script. This step only needs to be executed once per environment.

    * P01 Sync And Upload New Registration Packet(Preparation) - This thread group generates unique identity packets, and syncs them to PacketCreator tool. As a prerequisite, PacketCreator tool is required to run as background service. (Check PacketCreatorToolSetup.md to run this tool). The execution of this step is identical to PacketCreator_and_Upload_Test_Script.jmx`. The list of packets is stored in P01_request_body_sync_packet.txt

    * P03 Generate RID (Preparation) - If database has valid RIDs, this step is not required. Populate support-files/S03_reg_id.txt with the list of RIDs as shown in sample. If the database does not already consists of valid RIDs, this thread group can be used to create them. It will consume the data created by "P01 Sync And Upload New Registration Packet" and generate a list that can be used by "S03 Get Transaction Details From Reg Id". If this thread is executed. "P01 Sync And Upload New Registration Packet" should be re-executed to generate new data for "S01 Sync And Upload New Registration Packet".

	* NOTE - To run "S01 Sync And Upload New Registration Packet" post "P03 Generate RID", "P01 Sync And Upload New Registration Packet" needs to be re-executed so fresh data can be prepared. 

	* Additional preparation step - Make sure the "registration-processor-common-camel-bridge" pod is stopped before executing below test (Execution thread groups). (i.e. Number of pods = 0).
	
	* S01 Sync And Upload New Registration Packet(Execution) : 
		* S01 T01 Sync Registration Packet : This API endpoint will sync the packets in registration processor.
		* S01 T02 Upload Registration Packet : This API endpoint will upload the packets to registration processor.

	* S02 Sync Data From The Server (Execution) :
		* S02 T01 Auth Token Details Encrypted Based On Machine Key : This API endpoint sync the auth token details based on machine key.
		* S02 T02 Public Key Verify : This API endpoint verifies the public key generated.
		* S02 T03 Get Certificate : This API endpoint gets the certificates.
		* S02 T04 Get User Details : This API endpoint gets the user details.
		* S02 T05 Get Client Settings : This API endpoint gets the client settings.
		* S02 T06 Get Configs : This API endpoint gets the config settings.
		* S02 T07 Get LatestId Schema : This API endpoint gets the latest schema ID.
		* S02 T08 Get CaCertificates : This API endpoint gets CA certificates.

	* S03 Get Transaction Details From Reg Id (Execution) :
		* S03 T01 Get Transaction Details From Reg Id : This API endpoint will fetch the transaction details using reg id.


## Designing the workload model for performance test execution

* The script is preconfigured for 100 tps within our test environment. Performance may vary based on hardware and infrastructure settings.

* If you are testing for different tps or with different hardware settings, adjustment needs to made to thread group settings within the script.

* [MOSIP_TPS_Thread_setting_calculator-packet_credential_processing.xlsx](MOSIP_TPS_Thread_setting_calculator-RegProc_SyncData.xlsx) applies Little's law to recommend required thread settings inputs.			
					
## Support files required for this test execution:

1. [contextDetailJSON.txt](support-files/contextDetailJSON.txt) - This sample file contain various environment variables that need to be updated. It must contain a valid JSON. It is the primary input to use `mosip-packet-creator` tool. Documentation available in [PacketCreatorToolSetup](../PacketCreatorToolSetup.md).
2. [D01_A01_zones.csv](support-files/D01_A01_zones.csv) - This support file should contain list of valid zones code from master.zone table where a centre can be created. This file should be manually created.
3. [A01_A02_center_id.csv](support-files/A01_A02_center_id.csv) - This support file contains list of centers needed to create new machine. It can be created from step A01.
4. [A02_S02_machine_id.csv](support-files/A02_S02_machine_id.csv) - This support file contains list of machines in the master db. It can be created from step A02.
5. [D02_S02T03_KeyAlias.csv](support-files/D02_S02T03_KeyAlias.csv) - This support file contains list of Certificate details from keymgr.key_alias table. This file should be manually created.
6. [S03_reg_id.txt](support-files/reg_id.txt) - This support file contains list of registration IDs in the database. It can be directly retrieved from database. Alternatively, new registration IDs can be created from step P03.
