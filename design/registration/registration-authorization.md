# Design for the Registration - Authorization Module

## Background

Registration Client application should provide the facility to control the user role based authorization across the application in all the screens. Each user of the application will be provided with the separate role. The role based list of screen level access to be configured. Based on the role, the user should be allowed to view / act on specific set of screens. All should be configurable. If any changes required, the changes should be done in Admin portal and sync to the 'Registration Client' application. There shouldn't be any option provided to modify the configuration at client application.

## Target Users
- Registration officer, Supervisor and Admin person will have an access to the application. Based on their role configuration, the respective screens should be displayed.

## Key Requirements
-   Role creation
-   User role mapping
-   Screen configuration
-   Role based screen mapping
-   Before displaying screen to the user, validate the user role and access permission to the specific screen and render the screen or respective error message

## Key Non-Functional Requirements
- Connectivity:
    - Should able to communicate to the configured URL with proper authentication to invoke the respective sync job to get configuration from server
- Authentication:
    - While connecting to the server, user authentication is required to authenticate by providing the valid credentials
    - Invoke the Oauth service to get the 'Access token' and pass it along with the request to authenticate the request by the server
- Security:
    - No one should have permission to alter the data stored in the local db
    - The role access should be modifiable at admin portal only and later to be sync to the client application through the respective job
- Database:
    - Store the data retrieved in the sync job to the database table
    - All connection should be closed once db process completed

## Solution

### The key solution considerations are:
- LoginServiceImpl.java - When the user login validation is completed successfully then load the user specific role detail from "reg.user\_role" table.
- Fetch the role specific list of screen id access from 'reg.screen\_authorization' table.
- ScreenAuthorizationDAO.java -- implement the DAO specific logic into this component.
- ScreenAuthorizationRepository -- create 'findByScreenAuthorizationIdRoleCodeInAndIsPermittedTrueAndIsActiveTrue' method to fetch the role specific data.
- Load the list of valid screen ids and role to the UserContext object by invoking updateSessionContext() method.

### Screen Render Validation: 
- BaseController.validateScreenAuthorization() - Implement the logic to validate the current screen id against the data in the User Context object. If screen id available then allow the request to proceed. Otherwise display the information alert in the screen 'Please get permission to view this screen'.
- Extend the current UI specific controller with 'BaseController' and invoke the method 'validateScreenAuthorization' to validate the screen accessibility permissions.

### UI 
- Create the proper alert success/error to intimate the user.
- Apply the below common criteria
    - Audit
    - Log
    - Java Documentation
    - Junit
