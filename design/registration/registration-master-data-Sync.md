# Design - Master Data Sync

## Background

Registration application maintains the master data for the registration of the individual by using the configurable information. The master sync data will help the registration system identifying the list of documents, holidays, center ids, gender types, blocked user list, machine, devices list, template list. These data should act as a configuration for the registration application.

## Target Users
- Registration application
- Manual trigger by the Operator (Officer/Supervisor)
- Kernel

## Key Requirements
1. Allow the client to receive request to sync master data from a manual trigger or scheduled job.
    1. The timing and frequency of the scheduled job is set up through the back end.
    2. There should be no limit to the number of times and timing of triggering the manual sync.
2. Send request to server for master data sync.
3. Receive response from server with master data.
    1. Only the incremental changes (additions, deletions and modifications) made since the last sync should be received.
    2. Machine related master data should be received only for the specific machine from which request is initiated.
    3. Registration Centre related data should be received only for the specific Registration Centre mapped to the machine from which request is initiated.
    4. Device related data should be received only for devices mapped to the same Registration Centre as the machine from which request is initiated.
    5. Supervisor and Officer related data should be received only for those users mapped to the same Registration Centre as the machine from which request is initiated.
4. Save the incremental changes in the local machine.
5. Send success or failure message to the UI.
6. Display an alert in case of sync failure.
    1. The on-screen message should only indicate if the sync was a success or failure.
    2. Detailed errors can be viewed in the transaction logs.
7. When a sync is running, the client should not allow the end user to perform any other action.
8. If the client is not online or not open during a scheduled sync, the sync should be queued up and executed later. When the client is next launched and is online, check if the previous scheduled sync was executed. If not executed earlier, immediately start the sync.

## Key Non-Functional Requirements
- Security:
    - We should not store the RO/RS plain text credentials or any sensitive information.
    - The password should be not stored as raw data. It should be stored in hashed format.
    - The session key should be stored in the DB for each pre-registration packet.
    - The data resided in the database should be encrypted.
- Network:
    - URL should be communicated using the SSL mode.
- Log the each state of the packet Yet To Receive/Received/RID
- Generated/Deleted:
    - As a security measures the UIN or any sensitive individual information should not be logged.
- Other standard NFR, need to be taken care:
    - Logging, audit, exception handling.

## Solution
1. Create the **MasterSyncJob** with following methods as
    - executeJob - (triggerPoint)
2. Call the configured URL to the master sync system to get the configurtaion by using the TPM public key whcih was registered for the each machine.
3. Call the ServiceDelegatUtil --> invoke method to call the sync URL. Each URL was secured by token. 
    - If the trigger mode is batch the clienID/secret based token should be embedded as part of the header.
    - If the trigger mode is manual the token  should be passed based on the userid/pwd token should be embedded as part of the header.
4. Once got the response JSON, parse and store it to the respective master tables.
